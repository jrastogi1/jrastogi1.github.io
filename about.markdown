I am a third year undergraduate at University of Maryland - College Park, with two majors in Computer Science and Math, and a minor in Robotics and Autonomous Systems. I am drawn to this path for its interdisciplinary nature and ability to provide major real world impact in applications where it complements, but doesn't replace, humans. In particular, I am passionate about everything robotics software-related above embedded systems: distributed/multi-agent systems and communication, perception, planning, and everything in between. 

When I'm not immersed in the land of STEM, you can find me reading, listening to music, or hiking. One of my favorite quotes is, "Water continually dropping will wear hard rocks hollow,” by Plutarch, which inspires my dedication to pursuing long-term goals, one small increment at a time.

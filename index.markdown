# Welcome to My Portfolio
Hi, I'm **Jai Rastogi**, a third year undergraduate at University of Maryland - College Park. I specialize in computer vision, robotics, and reinforcement learning, and am passionate about experimenting with and challenging the boundaries of today's technology for real-world applications. Explore my portfolio to see my projects, and feel free to connect with me through the contact page!

## Work Experience
* Machine Learning Intern @ Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (June - December 2025)
* Machine Learning Research Intern @ DEVCOM Army Research Laboratory (June - August 2024)

## Featured Projects

### [LLM Model Serving Analysis](/projects/#llm-model-serving-analysis-october---december-2025)

TODO brief overview

### [Generative Adversarial Attacks on Image Classification](/projects/#generative-adversarial-attacks-on-image-classification-january---may-2025)

In the real world, systems using machine learning models can be adversarially attacked to change model inference results, such as deleting detections of a person in a surveillance camera. These attacks can cause bad actions or actors to go unnoticed. In this project, I trained a reinforcement learning agent to adversarially attack a pre-trained YOLOv11 image classifier using a novel generative approach. While it ultimately yielded poor results, it was a good learning experience.
